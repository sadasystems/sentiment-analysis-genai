# sentiment-analysis-genai
Demonstrates how to perform and evaluate text sentiment analysis with Google Cloud's PaLM model and the IMDB reviews dataset.

You can run the notebook in Google Colab, but because the notebook runs for many hours, you might want to run it either locally, or in a Vertex AI user-managed workbench. 

If you run the notebook locally, create a virtual environment first, and install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
